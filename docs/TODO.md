# TODO list

### Color chart
I gotta find something that looks better than the colors of the sky & everything, SOMETHING READABLE !

### Accessibility --- Retex-Display
Menu is but it's accessibility is next to nothing.
Find way to make it accessible

Possibility : focusable opacity:0 element checkbox that can display another accessible display ?
