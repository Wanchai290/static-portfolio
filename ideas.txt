Two main ideas around my head :

	Easy button - onClick() lists some items

	Hard display screen : Display buttons in column on left:
	onClick() will display on the right contentn about it

New ideas coming right up :

	RetEx sheets will be in a Display-like style.
	But I will use the Listing-like style to display the buttons
		though i need something that looks more professional-ish

On  the left :
    Welcoming
    Small presenetation


On the right :
    Slash-shaped image containing flags
    of languages I use



For some GODFORSAKEN REASON, the pictures do not respect their resizing
must start it again from scratch
guess what ? resizing imgs are harder than I thought
